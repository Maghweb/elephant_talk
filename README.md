# The Elephant Talk project
Elephant Talk is a youth active citizenship project created by Maghweb in collaboration with Impact Hub Labs, Polylogos and Young Educators funded by the EACEA in the CERV programme, Citizen‚Äôs Engagement and Participation strand. The project aims to engage young citizens across Europe in a collective, international collaborative data gathering and visualisation action against online gender-based hate speech with youth workers from their different communities. 

**This repo contains the data collected through the Elephant Talk survey that ran until April 30th, 2025**. The survey has been administered through the open-source and GDPR-compliant platform [FormBricks](https://formbricks.com/). The survey was sent in 8 different language versions: Catalan, Croatian, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, and Spanish. A total of 1.395 respondents began the survey, of which 706 (51%) completed all questions. The process of combining the 8 survey response files, one for each language, in a single cleaned English file has been achieved with a mix of Python, manual data cleaning, and assistance from Claude.ai, as detailed in the "Data Cleaning Documentation" file.

## Methodological Note

The patterns observed offer interesting insights, but should be understood as exploratory rather than confirmatory. In particular, we recommend not comparing country results with each other and always checking the sample size behind ‚Ä®the percentages.‚Ä®‚Ä®Because of how the survey was sent out and because of its length, it is likely that the results are prone to selection bias, meaning the individuals who care most about the issue are also the ones who are most represented. This could explain, for example, the over-representation of female participants in our study. 

The Romanian survey stands out because of the marked presence of a male young demographic of university students (41% of respondents are male vs. an average of 27%; 86% of respondents are 15-18 vs. an average of 32%; 85% are studying in university vs. an average of 31%). ‚Ä®Because the Romanian survey also contains the most responses (165), its unique dynamics are impacting the overall results more than those of other countries.

For all these reasons, the analysis should be valued mostly not for its statistical relevance but because it revealed potential areas and angles that could be further assessed through larger studies or actions. More importantly, the surveys served as a means to actively engage young people with the issue, representing a valuable exercise in building awareness and self-reflection.
