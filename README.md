# The Elephant Talk project
Elephant Talk is a youth active citizenship project created by Maghweb in collaboration with Impact Hub Labs, Polylogos and Young Educators funded by the EACEA in the CERV programme, Citizenâ€™s Engagement and Participation strand. The project aims to engage young citizens across Europe in a collective, international collaborative data gathering and visualisation action against online gender-based hate speech with youth workers from their different communities. Through a series of international gender-sensitive data gathering and visualisation training events for youth workers, locally driven international data gathering and visualisation actions and active dialogue between young people and members of the EU parliament, the project will foster young peopleâ€™s critical understanding and collective engagement with online gender-based hate speech as a systemic, EU-wide phenomenon.

## About this repo

This repo contains the data collected through the Elephant Talk survey that ran until April 30th, 2025. The survey has been administered through the open-source and GDPR-compliant platform [FormBricks](https://formbricks.com/). The survey was sent in 8 different language versions: Catalan, Croatian, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, and Spanish. The process of combining the 8 survey response files, one for each language, in a single cleaned English file has been achieved with a mix of Python, manual data cleaning, and assistance from Claude.ai, as detailed in the "Data Cleaning Documentation" file.
